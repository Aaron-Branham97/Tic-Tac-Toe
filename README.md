The first player to go will be player X. Click on a tile to place your "token" this will end your turn. Player O will then place his/her token and this will continue till either: Player X or Player O gets a 3 in a row or all tiles have been used and there cannont be a winner and this will result in a tie!

##Acknowledgements

The professor of my C++ course provided the random number generator and player input functions for this assignment. I wrote the game logic, secret code generator, and header file. The title was made using a text-to-ASCII-art generator found on this website.
